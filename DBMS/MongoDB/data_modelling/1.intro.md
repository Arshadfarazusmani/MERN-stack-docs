# Data Modelling with Mongoose

**Data modelling** is the process of defining the structure, relationships, and constraints of data stored in a database. In MongoDB, data is stored as documents in collections, and Mongoose helps you model this data in your Node.js applications.

## Why Data Modelling?

- **Structure:** Ensures your data follows a consistent format.
- **Validation:** Enforces rules for data integrity.
- **Relationships:** Defines how different pieces of data relate to each other.
- **Maintainability:** Makes your codebase easier to understand and manage.

## How Mongoose Helps

Mongoose allows you to define **schemas** and **models** for your MongoDB collections. A schema defines the shape and type of your documents, while a model provides an interface for interacting with the database.

## Example: Defining a Schema and Model

```js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

// Define a schema for a User
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({

    // schema 

},{timestamps:true});

// Create a model from the schema
export const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

## Relationships in Mongoose

You can model relationships between documents using references or embedding:

- **References (Normalization):** Store ObjectId references to documents in other collections.
  ```js
  const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: String,
    author: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }
  });
  ```
- **Embedding (Denormalization):** Store related data directly inside a document.
  ```js
  const commentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    text: String,
    user: {
      name: String,
      email: String
    }
  });
  ```

## Validation and Middleware

Mongoose schemas support built-in and custom validation, as well as middleware (hooks) for logic before or after certain operations (e.g., saving or updating documents).

## Summary

- Data modelling with Mongoose helps structure and validate your MongoDB data.
- Use schemas to define fields, types, and validation rules.
- Use models to interact with your collections.
- Model relationships using references or embedding, depending on your use case.

Mongoose makes it easier to manage and maintain your application's data layer in Node.js projects.
