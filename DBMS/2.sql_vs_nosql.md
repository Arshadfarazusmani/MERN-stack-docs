# SQL vs NoSQL Databases

Understanding the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases is important for choosing the right data storage solution for your application.

## What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language) databases** are relational databases that store data in tables with rows and columns. They use structured schemas and support powerful querying with SQL.

**Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server

## What is NoSQL?

**NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases** are non-relational databases designed for flexibility and scalability. They can store data in various formats such as documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs.

**Examples:** MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB, Neo4j

## Key Differences

| Feature           | SQL Databases                | NoSQL Databases                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Data Model**    | Relational (tables)         | Non-relational (varied types) |
| **Schema**        | Fixed, predefined           | Dynamic, flexible             |
| **Scalability**   | Vertical (scale-up)         | Horizontal (scale-out)        |
| **Transactions**  | ACID compliant              | Often eventual consistency    |
| **Query Language**| SQL                         | Varies (JSON, key-value, etc.)|
| **Examples**      | MySQL, PostgreSQL           | MongoDB, Cassandra            |

## When to Use SQL

- Data is structured and relationships are important
- Need for complex queries and transactions
- Strong consistency is required

## When to Use NoSQL

- Data is unstructured or semi-structured
- Need to scale horizontally (large, distributed systems)
- Flexible schema or rapid development is needed

## Summary

- **SQL** is best for structured data and complex queries.
- **NoSQL** is best for flexibility, scalability, and handling large volumes of diverse data.
