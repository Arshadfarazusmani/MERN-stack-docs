# MongoDB vs MySQL

Understanding the differences between MongoDB and MySQL helps you choose the right database for your application's needs.

## What is MongoDB?

**MongoDB** is a NoSQL, document-oriented database. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for dynamic schemas and easy scalability.

- **Type:** NoSQL (Document Store)
- **Schema:** Flexible, dynamic
- **Data Format:** BSON (Binary JSON)
- **Best For:** Unstructured or semi-structured data, rapid development, scalability

## What is MySQL?

**MySQL** is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It stores data in tables with rows and columns, using a fixed schema and SQL for queries.

- **Type:** Relational (SQL)
- **Schema:** Fixed, predefined
- **Data Format:** Tables (rows and columns)
- **Best For:** Structured data, complex queries, strong consistency

## Key Differences

| Feature             | MongoDB                        | MySQL                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Type**            | NoSQL (Document)              | SQL (Relational)             |
| **Schema**          | Dynamic/Flexible              | Fixed/Predefined             |
| **Data Storage**    | JSON-like Documents (BSON)    | Tables (Rows & Columns)      |
| **Scalability**     | Horizontal (sharding)         | Vertical (scaling up)        |
| **Transactions**    | Limited (multi-doc in v4.0+)  | Full ACID support            |
| **Query Language**  | MongoDB Query Language (MQL)  | Structured Query Language    |
| **Joins**           | Limited (via $lookup)         | Supported (JOIN statements)  |
| **Use Cases**       | Big data, real-time apps      | Banking, ERP, analytics      |

## When to Use MongoDB

- You need to store unstructured or rapidly changing data.
- Your application requires high scalability and availability.
- You want to develop quickly with flexible data models.

## When to Use MySQL

- Your data is highly structured and relationships are important.
- You need complex queries and transactions.
- Data integrity and consistency are critical.

## Summary

- **MongoDB** is ideal for flexible, scalable, and fast-evolving applications.
- **MySQL** is best for structured data, complex queries, and applications needing strong
