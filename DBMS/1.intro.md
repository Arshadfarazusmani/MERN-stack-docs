# Introduction to Databases

A **database** is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are essential for storing information in modern applications, from websites and mobile apps to enterprise systems.

## Why Use Databases?

- **Efficient Data Management:** Store, retrieve, and update large amounts of data quickly.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure accuracy and consistency of data.
- **Security:** Control access to sensitive information.
- **Scalability:** Handle growing amounts of data as applications expand.

## Types of Databases

- **Relational Databases (SQL):** Store data in tables with rows and columns. Use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying.
  - *Examples:* MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
- **NoSQL Databases:** Designed for flexibility and scalability. Store data in various formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.
  - *Examples:* MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis

## Common Database Operations

- **Create:** Add new data (records)
- **Read:** Retrieve existing data
- **Update:** Modify existing data
- **Delete:** Remove data

These operations are often referred to as **CRUD** operations.

## Summary

Databases are the backbone of most software systems, enabling efficient and secure data storage and retrieval. Choosing the right type of database depends on your application's needs and data
