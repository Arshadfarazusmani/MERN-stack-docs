# Introduction to Web Development 
Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It encompasses everything from the visual design of a website to its underlying programming and database management.

### Three Core Areas of Web Development:

- Frontend Development :  Also known as client-side development, focuses on the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) - everything that users see and interact with on a website, like its design, layout, and structure.


- Backend Development: Also referred to as server-side development, involves the logic and data processing that happens behind the scenes and is not directly visible to users. This includes database management, server configuration, and website functionality.


- Full Stack Development: Involves proficiency in both front-end and back-end development, allowing developers to create a website or web application from start to finish. 

### Key Technologies and Concepts:

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The foundation of web pages, providing the structure and organization of content using elements like headings, paragraphs, and images.

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to style the HTML content and control the visual appearance of a website, including colors, fonts, layouts, and responsiveness to different devices.

- JavaScript: A scripting language that adds dynamic behavior and interactivity to websites, handling elements like buttons, animations, and form validation.

- Web Browsers: Application software that runs on the user's machine and renders the web pages sent by the server.

- Web Servers: Systems that store and deliver web pages to users upon request.

- Databases: Where websites store and organize data, such as user details or product information. Examples include MySQL and MongoDB.

- Web Protocols (HTTP/HTTPS): Standardized rules that govern data exchange between devices on the internet.

- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Sets of rules that allow different software applications to communicate and exchange data.

- Version Control: Systems like Git help manage code evolution and collaboration, especially in teams.

- Frameworks and Libraries: Pre-written code and tools that expedite development, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js for the frontend, or Django, Flask, and Laravel for the backend.
