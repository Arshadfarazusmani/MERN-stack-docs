# How web works

The World Wide Web (WWW) operates as a client-server system built upon the infrastructure of the Internet. Here's a breakdown of how it works: 

You (the client) make a request:

-  When you want to visit a website, you type its URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into your web browser or click on a hyperlink.

- Your web browser (the client software) acts as an interface between you and the web server. 

 DNS Lookup:

- The browser needs to find the server that hosts the requested website. To do this, it first performs a DNS lookup.

- It sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate the human-readable domain name (like www.example.com) into an IP address (a numerical address like 192.0.2.172). 

Establishing a connection:

- Once the browser has the server's IP address, it establishes a connection with the server.

- This is typically done using TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). 

Sending an HTTP request:

- The browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server.


- This request tells the server what action to perform (e.g., GET for retrieving a web page) and identifies the requested resource using the URL. 

The server processes the request:

- The web server (a computer or software that stores and delivers web content) receives the HTTP request.

- It locates the requested resource (e.g., an HTML file, image, or video).

Sending an HTTP response:

- The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser.

- This response includes a status code (e.g., 200 OK for a successful request or 404 Not Found if the resource isn't found) and the requested web page data (often in HTML format)

The browser renders the web page:
 

- The browser receives the HTML data and other resources (like CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity).
Its rendering engine interprets these files and displays the web page to you.
