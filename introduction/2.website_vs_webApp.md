# Website Vs Web Application 
## Website:
Purpose: Primarily designed to deliver content and information to users for viewing and browsing.
Content: Usually comprises static content that remains the same unless manually updated. While they can have dynamic elements like blogs or news sections that update over time, the core functionality is generally focused on displaying information.
User Interaction: Limited to minimal interaction, such as clicking links or viewing images. Users cannot typically interact with and modify the content on the website.
Development: Can be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on frontend elements.
Examples: Blogs, news sites, company information websites, online magazines. 

## Webapplication

Purpose: Developed for interaction with end-users, allowing them to manipulate data and perform complex tasks.
Content: Dynamic, meaning the content changes based on user interactions and data updates. They use real-time data and provide several features for users to customize and save data.
User Interaction: Allows for two-way communication, where users can input data, perform actions, and receive `tailored content or personalized experiences.`
Development: More complex, involving both frontend and backend development with server-side languages (e.g., Java, Python,js) and frameworks (e.g., Django, React), along with databases to store and manage data.
`Examples: Email programs (Gmail), online banking systems, social media platforms (Facebook), productivity tools (Google Docs), e-commerce platforms. `
