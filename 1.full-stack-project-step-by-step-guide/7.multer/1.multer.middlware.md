```js
import multer from "multer";  // nodejs middleware for handling multipart/form-data and storing files

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: function (req, file, cb) {
      cb(null, './public/temp/')
    },
    filename: function (req, file, cb) {
      
      cb(null, file.originalname)
    }
  })

const upload = multer({ storage: storage })

export {upload};

```

Hereâ€™s an explanation of the code:

- `import multer from "multer";`  
  Imports the Multer library, which is used to handle file uploads in Node.js/Express apps.

- `const storage = multer.diskStorage({...})`  
  Configures how and where uploaded files will be stored on disk:
  - `destination`: Sets the folder (`./public/temp/`) where files will be saved.
  - `filename`: Sets the name of the saved file to be the same as the original uploaded file.

- `const upload = multer({ storage: storage })`  
  Creates an upload middleware using the storage settings above.

- `export {upload};`  
  Exports the `upload` middleware so it can be used in your Express routes to handle file uploads.

**Usage example in an Express route:**
```js
app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File uploaded!');
});
```
This will save the uploaded file to `./public/temp/` with its original name.
