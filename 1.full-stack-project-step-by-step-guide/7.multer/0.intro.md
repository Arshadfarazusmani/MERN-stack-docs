# Multer middleware 
Multer is a Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. It works with Express and helps process files sent through HTTP requests (like images, documents, etc.), making them accessible in your server-side code. Multer saves uploaded files to disk or memory and provides information about each file (such as filename, size, and path) in the request object.
