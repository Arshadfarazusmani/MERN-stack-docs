# User Routes

This file defines the Express routes related to user operations, such as registration. It uses middleware for file uploads and connects the route to the appropriate controller.

## Code

```js
import { Router } from "express";
import { registerUser } from "../controllers/user.controllers.js";
import { upload } from "../middleware/multer.middleware.js";

const router = Router();

router.route('/register').post(
    upload.fields([
        { 
            name: "avatar",
            maxCount: 1
        },
        {
            name: "coverImage",
            maxCount: 1 
        }
    ]),
    registerUser
);

export default router;
```

- **Export:** Exports the router to be used in the main application.

This setup allows users to register with profile images and ensures the request is processed by the correct
