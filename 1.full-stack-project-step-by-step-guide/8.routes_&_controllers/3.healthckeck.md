# Healthcheck routes and controllers 

**Controllers** are functions or modules in a web application that contain the logic for handling incoming requests and generating responses. They act as the "brains" behind each route, processing data, interacting with databases or other services, and determining what to send back to the client.

**Routes** connect url path to appropriate controller function 

### healthcheck.controllers.js 
```js
import { api_response } from "../utils/api_response.js";
import { async_handler } from "../utils/async_handler.js";

const health_check= async_handler(async(req,res)=>{

    
    res.status(200).json(new api_response(200,"ok"))
})

export{health_check}
```
### healthcheck.routes.js

```js
import { Router } from "express";
import { health_check } from "../controllers/healthchek.controllers.js";


const router = Router() 

router.route("/").get(health_check)

export default router

```
