# What are Controllers?

**Controllers** are functions or modules in a web application that contain the logic for handling incoming requests and generating responses. They act as the "brains" behind each route, processing data, interacting with databases or other services, and determining what to send back to the client.

## Why Use Controllers?

- **Separation of Concerns:** Controllers keep your route definitions clean by moving business logic out of the route files.
- **Reusability:** You can reuse controller functions across different routes.
- **Maintainability:** Organizing logic into controllers makes your codebase easier to manage and scale.

## Example in Express.js

```js
// userController.js
export function getUser(req, res) {
  // Logic to get a user by ID
  res.send('User details');
}

export function createUser(req, res) {
  // Logic to create a new user
  res.send('User created');
}
```

```js
// routes.js
import express from 'express';
import { getUser, createUser } from './userController.js';

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/user/:id', getUser);
router.post('/user', createUser);

export default router;
```

In this example:
- The controller functions (`getUser`, `createUser`) handle the actual logic for each route.
- The route definitions simply connect URL paths to the appropriate controller functions.
