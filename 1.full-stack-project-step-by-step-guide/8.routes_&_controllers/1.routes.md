# Example: Express Route for Health Check

This code sets up a simple health check route using Express. Hereâ€™s a dry run of what happens:

## Code

```js
import { Router } from "express";
import { health_check } from "../controllers/healthchek.controllers.js";

const router = Router();

router.route("/").get(health_check);

export default router;
```

## Dry Run (Step-by-Step)

1. **Import Dependencies**
   - `Router` is imported from Express to create a modular route handler.
   - `health_check` is imported from your controllers, which contains the logic for the health check endpoint.

2. **Create Router Instance**
   - `const router = Router()` creates a new router object.

3. **Define Route**
   - `router.route("/")` targets the root path (`/`) of this router.
   - `.get(health_check)` attaches the `health_check` controller to handle GET requests to `/`.

4. **Export Router**
   - `export default router` makes this router available for use in your main app file.

## What Happens When You Visit `/`?

- When a GET request is made to `/`, Express calls the `health_check` function.
- The `health_check` function executes and sends a response (usually something like `{ status: "OK" }`).

**Result:**  
You get a simple endpoint to check if your API/server is running and healthy.
