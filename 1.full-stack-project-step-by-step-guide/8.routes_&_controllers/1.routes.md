# What are Routes?

In web development, **routes** are definitions that map HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific functions in your application. Each route specifies a URL path and an HTTP method, and tells the server how to respond when that path is requested.

## Why are Routes Important?

Routes allow you to organize your application logic and handle different types of requests. For example, you might have:
- `/users` to get a list of users
- `/users/:id` to get a specific user by ID
- `/upload` to handle file uploads

## Example in Express.js

```js
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

// Define a GET route
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

// Define a POST route
app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Form submitted!');
});
```

In this example:
- `app.get('/hello', ...)` handles GET requests to `/hello`
- `app.post('/submit', ...)` handles POST requests to `/submit`

Routes help structure your application and make it easy to manage different
