# JWT -> jsonwebtoken 

## What is a JWT?
A JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

How JWT Works (Example Flow)
User Login:

Client sends credentials (e.g., username/password).

Server validates and generates a JWT.

Token Usage:

Client stores the JWT (e.g., in localStorage or cookies).

For subsequent requests, the client sends the JWT in the Authorization header:


Server checks the signature to ensure the JWT is valid.

If valid, grants access to protected routes.

Use Cases

âœ… Authentication (e.g., login sessions)
âœ… Stateless APIs (no server-side session storage needed)
âœ… Secure data exchange (between microservices)

Security Considerations

ðŸ”’ Always use HTTPS to prevent token theft.
ðŸ”’ Set a short expiration time (exp claim).
ðŸ”’ Avoid storing sensitive data in the payload.
