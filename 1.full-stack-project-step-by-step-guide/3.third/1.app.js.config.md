# Creating APP 
```js
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

export  {app}; // we can import app in our index file.
```


The configurations added to your Express application in 

app.js

 are essential for handling various aspects of HTTP requests and responses. Here's a detailed explanation of each configuration and why they are important:

### 1. CORS Middleware:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN,
    credentials: true
}));
```
- **Purpose**: The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware allows your server to handle requests from different origins (domains). This is crucial for enabling web applications running on different domains to access your API.
- **Configuration**:
  - 

origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN

: Specifies the allowed origin(s) for cross-origin requests. The value is taken from an environment variable 

CORS_ORIGIN

.
  - 

credentials: true

: Allows cookies and HTTP authentication information to be included in cross-origin requests.

### 2. JSON Middleware:
```javascript
app.use(express.json({
    limit: '16kb'
}));
```
- **Purpose**: The JSON middleware parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and makes the parsed data available in `req.body`. This is essential for handling POST, PUT, and PATCH requests where the client sends data in JSON format.
- **Configuration**:
  - 

limit: '16kb'

: Sets the maximum size of the JSON payload that the middleware will accept. This helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by limiting the size of incoming JSON data.

### 3. URL-encoded Middleware:
```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
    limit: '16kb'
}));
```
- **Purpose**: The URL-encoded middleware parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (typically sent by HTML forms) and makes the parsed data available in `req.body`.
- **Configuration**:
  - 

extended: true

: Uses the `qs` library to parse URL-encoded data, allowing for rich objects and arrays to be encoded into the URL-encoded format.
  - 

limit: '16kb'

: Sets the maximum size of the URL-encoded payload that the middleware will accept, similar to the JSON middleware.

### 4. Static Middleware:
```javascript
// serve static files from the 'public' directory.
app.use(express.static('public'));
```
- **Purpose**: The static middleware serves static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets from the specified directory. This is essential for serving client-side resources.
- **Configuration**:
  - 

express.static('public')

: Specifies the `public` directory as the location from which to serve static files.

### Summary:
- **CORS Middleware**: Enables cross-origin requests, allowing your API to be accessed from different domains.
- **JSON Middleware**: Parses JSON payloads in incoming requests, making it easier to handle JSON data.
- **URL-encoded Middleware**: Parses URL-encoded payloads, typically from HTML forms, making it easier to handle form data.
- **Static Middleware**: Serves static files from the specified directory, providing client-side resources like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

These configurations are essential for building a robust and secure Express application that can handle various types of requests and serve necessary resources to clients.
