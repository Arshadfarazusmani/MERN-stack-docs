# DB Connection 


* We will write our Database connection program into seprate folder (src/db/db.js) inside src dir .

## Declaration of DB_Name 
Declare the your Database name inside (src/constants.js ) and export it .

```js
// src/constant.js
export const DB_name="temp_Db";
```

## [Src/db/db.js]
### Important points :
- DB connection task is time taking and error prone so alwayes use async await for asyncronus exicution of the Db connection program/code . And also wrap the code inside try catch .

(The code in the try block is executed first, and if it throws an exception, the code in the catch block will be executed.)

## Source-code-break-down

## 1. importing required modules 
```js
import mongoose from "mongoose"; 
import {DB_name} from "../constants.js" 
```
A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function or import 

    mongoose -> Node module 

    DB_name -> user defined module 

## 2. getting DB_URI from .env 

```js
const DB_URI=process.env.MONGO_URI

```

## 3. writing DB connection logic .

point to concider, use async await  for asyncronus exicution and try catch for exception handling 

The provided code defines an asynchronous function connectDB that attempts to connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the code:
```js
const connectDB= async function(){  // function definition 
   try{
    const connectionInstance= await mongoose.connect(`${DB_URI}/${DB_name}`)
    console.log("Database connected successfully to", connectionInstance.connection.name)
   }catch(error){
    console.log("DB connection Error !!!",error)
    process.exit(1);

   }
};

```
### 1. Function Definition:
```js
const connectDB = async function() {};
```
Defines an asynchronous function named connectDB.

### 2. Try Block:

try Block: Contains code that attempts to connect to the database.

```js
try {
    const connectionInstance = await mongoose.connect(`${DB_URI}/${DB_name}`);
    console.log("Database connected successfully to", connectionInstance.connection.name);
}

```

await mongoose.connect(...): Uses Mongoose's connect method to establish a connection to the MongoDB database. The connection string is constructed using template literals, combining DB_URI and DB_name.



DB_URI: The base URI for the MongoDB server

### 3. Catch Block:

```js
 catch (error) {
    console.log("DB connection Error !!!", error);
    process.exit(1);
}
```
catch Block: Executes if an error occurs during the connection attempt.

console.log(...): Logs an error message to the console, including the error details.

process.exit(1): Exits the Node.js process with a status code of 1, indicating an error.

## 4 Exporting the module 

```js
export {connectDB};
```
we can import ConnectDB wherever we need to connect Db .

## 5 Purpose:
Asynchronous Connection: The function uses async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of the database connection.

Error Handling: The try/catch block ensures that any errors during the connection attempt are caught and logged, and the process exits gracefully if a connection cannot be established.

Logging: Provides informative messages about the success or failure of the database connection.

In summary, the connectDB function is designed to establish a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, handle any potential errors, and log the outcome to the console.
