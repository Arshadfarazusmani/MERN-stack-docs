# Hooks 

Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components

## useState()

useState() is a React Hook for adding state to functional components.

Purpose: Manages a component's internal data that can change over time.

```js
const [stateValue, setStateFunction] = useState(initialValue);

```

Returns: An array with two elements:

The current state value.

A function to update the state.

Key Behavior:

The initialValue is only used on the first render.

Calling setStateFunction triggers a re-render of the component.

State updates are asynchronous and batched by React.

Example

```js

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}

```

## useCallback

useCallback() is a React Hook for performance optimization.

Purpose: To prevent unnecessary re-creations of functions during component re-renders.

```js
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
  () => { /* function body */ },
  [dependency1, dependency2] // Dependency array
);

```

Returns: A memoized (cached) version of the function.

Key Behavior:

The function is only re-created if one of the values in the dependency array changes.

If dependencies are the same, it returns the exact same function instance from the previous render.

This prevents a new prop reference from forcing a child component to re-render.



## useEffect
