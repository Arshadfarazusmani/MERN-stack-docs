# Redux 
The heart of modern state management in JS applications. 

1. Redux (The Core Library)
What it is: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It's a standalone library and is not tied to any specific UI framework like React. It can be used with Angular, Vue, or even vanilla JavaScript.

Core Principles:

Single Source of Truth: The entire state of your application is stored in a single object called the "store."

State is Read-Only: The only way to change the state is by emitting an action, a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened.

Changes are Made with Pure Functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state. They never mutate the original state.

The "Classic" Redux problem: While powerful, using the core Redux library can be verbose. It requires a lot of "boilerplate" code to set up the store, write actions, and create reducers with complex switch statements. This is where Redux Toolkit comes in.

2. Redux Toolkit (The Modern Standard)
What it is: Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, opinionated, "batteries-included" toolset for efficient Redux development. It was created by the Redux team to simplify the Redux workflow and solve the common pain points of using the core library.

Why you should use it:

Reduces Boilerplate: It provides utility functions that significantly cut down on the amount of code you need to write.

Simplified Store Setup: configureStore automatically sets up the Redux DevTools Extension and includes useful middleware like redux-thunk by default.

"Slices" of State: The createSlice function is a game-changer. It combines the creation of action types, action creators, and reducers for a single part of your state into a single function call.

Immutable Updates without the hassle: RTK uses the Immer library internally. This allows you to write "mutating" logic inside your reducers, and Immer takes care of producing a new, immutable state behind the scenes. This makes the code much more intuitive.

Built-in Async Logic: createAsyncThunk simplifies the process of handling asynchronous actions (like API calls) by automatically generating pending, fulfilled, and rejected action types.

In short: Redux Toolkit is the recommended way to write Redux logic today. It's a wrapper around the core Redux library that makes it much easier and more efficient to use.

3. React Redux (The "Binding" for React)
What it is: React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It is a separate library that allows your React components to "talk" to the Redux store.

Why you need it: Redux is framework-agnostic. React Redux provides the necessary tools to connect your React components to the Redux state, so they can:

Read data from the store: Using the useSelector hook, a component can subscribe to specific pieces of state and re-render only when that data changes. This is a key performance optimization.

Dispatch actions to the store: Using the useDispatch hook, a component can dispatch actions to trigger state changes.

Key components and hooks:

<Provider>: This component wraps your entire React application and makes the Redux store available to all nested components.

useSelector: A hook for extracting data from the Redux store.

useDispatch: A hook for dispatching actions to the Redux store.

Summary: How They Work Together
Redux Toolkit is what you use to write your state management logic (reducers, actions, store setup). It is the most modern and efficient way to interact with the Redux core.

The Redux core library is what Redux Toolkit builds upon. You generally don't interact with it directly when using RTK.

React Redux is what you use inside your React components to connect them to the store you created with Redux Toolkit. It provides the hooks (useSelector, useDispatch) that make the data flow between the store and your components seamless.

To build a modern React application with Redux, you will use both Redux Toolkit and React Redux. You will install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux and use them together.
