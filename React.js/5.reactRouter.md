# React Router

React Router is the standard library for client-side routing in React applications. React is focused solely on building user interfaces and does not have a built-in routing solution. This means that to handle navigation between different "pages" or views in a Single-Page Application (SPA), you need an external library like React Router.

Instead of a user's browser sending a request to a server for a new HTML page every time they click a link, React Router intercepts the request and dynamically renders the appropriate components on the client side. This provides a fast, seamless user experience without a full page reload.
