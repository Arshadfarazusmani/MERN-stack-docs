# Introduction to Node.js

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a browser, typically on servers or local machines. This enables the creation of server-side tools and applications using JavaScript.

## Key Features

- **Open-source & Cross-platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
- **JavaScript Everywhere:** Write both client-side and server-side code in JavaScript, reducing context switching between languages.
- **High Performance:** Designed for throughput and scalability, making it ideal for real-time web applications.
- **Modern Language Benefits:** JavaScript is a modern language with many improvements over older server-side languages. Many other languages (like TypeScript, CoffeeScript, etc.) can also compile to JavaScript.
- **npm Ecosystem:** The Node Package Manager (npm) gives access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages and tools, with excellent dependency management and automation capabilities.
- **Portability:** Node.js is supported by most operating systems and many web hosting providers.
- **Active Community:** A large, active developer community provides extensive support, documentation, and third-party modules.

## Why Use Node.js for Web Development?

- **Performance:** Node.js is optimized for high throughput and scalability, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Unified Language:** Using JavaScript on both the client and server simplifies development.
- **Rich Ecosystem:** npm offers a vast library of packages to speed up development.
- **Portability & Support:** Node.js runs on many platforms and is widely supported by hosting providers.

## Example Use Case

You can use Node.js to create a simple web server using its built-in HTTP module, or build complex, scalable web applications using frameworks like Express.js.
